> Lean 4 formalization of the Evolution Protocol schemas.

## What This Formalizes

This repository provides a Lean 4 formalization
of the structural core of the Evolution Protocol,
including canonical record schemas for
entities, relationships, and evolutions;
a shared RecordEnvelope;
retention-policy data shapes;
and basic graph-oriented data structures.
The code machine-checks the well-formedness and
typing of these structures and verifies that
the protocol's core representations are
internally consistent and composable,
without embedding causal, normative, or policy interpretations.
